        <Feature icon="mdi:tailwind" title="FDM 3D Printer">
          Engineered a fully functional extruder and baseplate moving mechanism for an FDM 3D Printer using 
          solidworks. Conducted comprehensive part selection and cost analysis. Made engineering 
          drawings and specifications.
        </Feature>
        <Feature icon="mdi:wheelchair-accessibility" title="Air Compressed Piston">
          Fabricated a piston from an aluminum block by reading engineering drawings and specifications, 
          and employed precision machining tools like Lathe, Mill, and Drill Press. Executed advanced 
          design calculations for optimal center of gravity. 
        </Feature>
        <Feature icon="mdi:looks" title="Smart Alerting Bracelet">
          Developed an alerting bracelet tailored for a girl with ADHD, in collaboration with clients 
          from St. Lawrence College.
          Successfully executed the engineering design process, including Concept Design Specifications (CDS) 
          and prototyping.
        </Feature>
        <Feature icon="mdi:eslint" title="Music Genre Categorization Using Deep Learning">
        Performed data augmentation on GTZAN dataset, visualized the audio signals in the time domain, 
        analyzed the frequency components of the audio signal over 0.01-second intervals by applying FFT, 
        and generated spectrograms for the audio samples.
        Used feature extractor - AlexNet neural network and implemented a fully connected neural network as the classifier.

        </Feature>
        <Feature icon="mdi:book-open-page-variant" title="Gearbox Design">
          Designed a right-angle gearbox with a 3:1 reduction ratio using solidworks, applying GD&T to all drawings. Employed lean six sigma technique and achieved efficient rapid prototyping with an emphasis 
          on design for manufacturability, limiting print time to under 6 hours and assembly to less than 10 minutes.
        </Feature>
        <Feature icon="mdi:language-markdown" title="Markdown & MDX">
          Easily use .md and .mdx pages to build your websites or use it with Netlify CMS.
